I'm a software engineer building products with [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/),
currently at [Ahrefs](http://ahrefs.com/). Before that, I worked on frontend
infrastructure at [Webflow](http://webflow.com/).

I am the author of some [open source projects](https://github.com/jchavarri)
(mostly in OCaml) and I am also a contributor to frontend or tooling projects
like [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/),
[Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange) or
[genType](https://github.com/cristianoc/genType).

I am very interested on programming languages and language design from the
purely technical perspective, but also and especially from the human point of
view: how they affect and relate with remote work, team cooperation, products
maintenance and evolution, software quality, and personal happiness.
